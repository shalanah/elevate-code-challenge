## Running

## Tech used

- React, TS, VIte
- Tailwind CSS, Styled-components, React Icons, Radix UI
  - I'm new to Tailwind this year. I selected it to get more practice but fell back to styled-components for the sake of time
- React Query, React Router
  - I considered Next.js but wanted to try out React Query again
